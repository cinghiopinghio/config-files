# Config Files

In this repository I mantain my dotfiles for the following apps:

- vim
- bash
- git
- gnuplot
- screen 
- latexmk

## Installation:

Go to this folder and type:

`make install`

It will create links to your home directory. 
Any preexistent configuration file can be deleted.

## TODO:

transform all of the shell functions (or most of them) in scripts.
