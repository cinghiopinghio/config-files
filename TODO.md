# Things todo

## some questions:

- change makefile to script?
  This would make life easier and things more flexible.
  A Makefile is nice because is everywhere and one can just use `make`

## todos

- [ ] rename `config-*` to `dotfiles-*`
- [ ] rename repo to dotfiles
- [ ] move `dotfiles-*` to their own repos
- [ ] plan simple config file (with fallbacks)
- [ ] move `swallow` to subfolder (and rename?)
