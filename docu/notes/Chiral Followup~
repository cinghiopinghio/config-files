Chiral Followup

TODO:
• CQW: applications
• Dynamical phases / Perfect transport
• TRS breaking in quantum gates circuits
• Quantum Page Rank (QPR)
• Spectral analysis

In particular:

On the first point:
• CQW on different graphs. for instance try the one-phase optimization; try to 
explain how to direct through the shortest path
• Lieb-Robinson bound (with only one-phase)
• Dissipation vs Chirality
• Currents
• Exactely solvable models (perfect transfer)

On the fourth point:
• QPR for quantum mechanics
• QPR with phases for Google
