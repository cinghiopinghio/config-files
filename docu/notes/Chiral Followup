Chiral Followup

                                     * * *

TODO 
Communities:
• Define communities (classically)
• try different kind of networks (ad hoc)
• optimization:
   • shortest path
   • END-neighbors
   • ONE-phase

Lieb Robinson Bound:
• Write proof
• run some simulation

Google:
• difference RW, QW, CQW 
• run them on a biological system
• pn=lim→inf 1/T int_0^T pn(t)dt

Network Theory:
• define centralities

                                     * * *

PLAN:
• CQW: applications
• Dynamical phases / Perfect transport
• TRS breaking in quantum gates circuits
• Quantum Page Rank (QPR)
• Spectral analysis

In particular:
On the first point:
• CQW on different graphs. for instance try the one-phase optimization; try to 
explain how to direct through the shortest path
• Lieb-Robinson bound (with only one-phase)
• Dissipation vs Chirality
• Currents
• Exactely solvable models (perfect transfer)

On the fourth point:
• QPR for quantum mechanics
• QPR with phases for Google
